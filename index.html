                Cinnamoroll is a Sanrio character and a member of the Cinnamoroll universe. He was born on March 15th, on a cloud far up in the sky. He is a small, shy chubby boy dog with white fur, blue eyes, pink cheeks, a plump and curly tail that resembles a cinnamon roll (hence his name), and long ears that enable him to fly. He is loved by embiplays.
